        <p>
            I am the owner and main operator of 802 Sitters. Ever since I was a kid I’ve always wanted to be able to take care of other peoples animals, due to the fact we could not have animals in our house growing up. 
So I made it my mission to help neighbors and friends pets while they were away on vacation and trips! This rewarding hobby as a young adult as now bloomed into an amazing business where I can help your pets feel at ease while you are away. I have a cat with my wife, named Mia, who has taught me a great deal about pet ownership over the last 7 years.
